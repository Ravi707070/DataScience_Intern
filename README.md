## Key Techniques Used
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for Visualizations

Geographical and Time-Based Analysis

## Insights Generated
Classified customers into 4 strategic segments:

VIP Customers – Most profitable

Regular Customers – Consistent spenders

One-Time Buyers – Low conversion

Location-Focused Customers – Regionally important

## Identified:

High-revenue cities and states

Month-wise sales trends

Year-over-year segment shifts

Product-level performance by region

## How to Run the App (Optional)
If app.py is a Streamlit app:
```
streamlit run app.py

```

## Sample Visualizations
Bar charts of the top cities

Heatmaps of customer locations

Pie charts of segment distribution

Monthly sales trend graphs

All visuals are stored inside the Sales_Dataset/ folder.

## Future Enhancements
Automate weekly sales updates using dashboards

Integrate customer feedback data for improved targeting

Deploy a full web dashboard (Power BI/Streamlit) for real-time monitoring
